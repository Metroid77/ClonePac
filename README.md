The module is a plastic container with a litte PCB and some electronics on it.

Components you need:
* a piece of single sided PCB for etching (see video)
* a 24LC16B/P I2C Serial EEPROM
* 7way 2mm pitch Receptacle (female) header
* 3K3 5% 0.5W resistor
* a good soldering iron with a small tip
* a mulimeter to find the errors by soldring
